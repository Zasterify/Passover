Cool. Now for another practice. 

You are not allowed to import any math tools yet. Use your math knowledge to figure out this one. 

Ok. Good. Now you know how to perform actions using a list such as adding and multiplying. Make sure you 
keep looking over everyting we have done up to this point because they will be building on each other. 

For this next part, we are going to learn how to find the length of a list. It is very similar to how you 
did total and multiplication
- Define a function called `LengthHalved` that takes in one list parameter called `givenlist`
- Use a loop to find out how long the list is. For example a list of [1,2,3] is of length 3. 
- If the length of the list is even, the function should return half of the length of the list
    - A list of length 14 would return 7
- If the length is odd, the function should return half+1 of the length of the list.
    - A list of length 11 would return 6
- Full comment and commiting practice apply here. 
- Make sure you test your code similar to the way we did in total and multiplication.
