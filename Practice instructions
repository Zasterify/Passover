Cool. Now for another practice. 

You are not allowed to import any math tools yet. Use your math knowledge to figure out this one. 
Create a new branch and call it `stats`

This time i want a folder called `Statistics` with a file called "stats.py"
    - Look over your functions. I want you to give them meaninful comments that explain what each line is doing. 
        I will give an example using the multiply function. 
    - Do not copy mine, but make your own to fit what you will understand. 
    - Do not just put comments to have it. Put it to be meaningful. 
    - After we are done, i will give the function to my dad and based on your comments he should be able to fully understand what it does and why every line is necessary. 

Remember to keep commenting, branching, commiting, your work.
