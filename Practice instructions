Define a new branch called thirdPractice. 

Inside third practice make a new folder called Laboratory 2. 
Inside Laboratory 2, make a file called ParameterOne.py. 
Inside ParameterOne.py, define a function called firstParameter that takes in one argument called word. 
    - firstParameter should `return` the `word` passed in
After you are done, on a line ask the user to input a word and save that to a variable. 
Then call your function with the variable passed in as the parameter. 

Example:
"Enter a word here: "       <-- I enter hello. 
Then if i call print(firstParameter(word))      <-- Prints out hello
