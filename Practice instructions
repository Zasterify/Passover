Cool. Now for another practice. 

You are not allowed to import any math tools yet. Use your math knowledge to figure out this one. 
Create a new branch and call it `stats`

This time i want a folder called `Statistics` with a file called "stats.py"
    - Inside `Stats.py`, define a function called total
    - Total must take in one parameter that will be a list of numbers
    - Using a `for` loop, add all the elements in the list together
    - Return the total number. 

Remember to keep commenting, branching, commiting, your work.
