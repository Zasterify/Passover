Cool. Now for another practice. 

You are not allowed to import any math tools yet. Use your math knowledge to figure out this one. 
Create a new branch and call it `stats`

This time i want a folder called `Statistics` with a file called "stats.py"
    - Comment the total function similar to the way you did with multiplication
    - Also, i noticed your commit messages are just generic names with some numbers. That is not good practice. 
    I should be able to know exactly what you changed in the file from your commit messages without even opening the file, 
    so practice commiting with messages that show what you did. Bascially, the message should show in one sentence what you 
    performed before you commited. Notice the way i do my commit messages. 

Remember to keep commenting, branching, commiting, your work.
