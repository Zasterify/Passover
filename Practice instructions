BEFORE YOU BEGIN. MAKE SURE YOU READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS FIRST. I MEAN EVERYTHING TO THE LAST DETAIL!!

Ok. This one should be really easy. Just a few things to clean up then, we can continue tomorrow morning. 
If you want to do something in the mean time i suggest you look into how to use "parameters" in python, to 
get a head start. That is what we i will give you work on tomorrow.

Do the following. 
1. Merge the secondPractice branch into master.
2. In repeat.py, remove the 'extra' docstrings you made. Remember docstrings should only be with the functions definition (def)
3. Add comments to every line of the file. (This is a little exessive. Depends on what kind of programmer you ask, 
    but to practice for now and to make sure you understand what you are doing, use comments) Remeber, you do not 
    have to comment the "def" line because the docstring is the comment. 

    Example: 
    x = input("Enter a word: ")     # Accepts an input from the user <-- This is the comment.
    print(x)       # Prints to the console <-- This is the comment.
4. In parrot.py, add comments to the file similar to the way you just did with repeat.py

When you are done, let me know and then if good, we will continue tomorrow. 

REMEMBER TO COMMIT AND PUSH!
