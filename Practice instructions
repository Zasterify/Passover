Cool. Now for another practice. 

You are not allowed to import any math tools yet. Use your math knowledge to figure out this one. 

This time i want a file called "Stats.py"
    - Stats.py should contain four functions, mean, meadian, mode, and values. 
    - mean should take in one parameter which is a list and must return the mean of all the numbers
    - meadian should take in one parameter which is a list and must return the median of all the numbers
    - mode should take in one parameter which is a list and must return the mode of all the numbers. 
    - values should take in one parameter which is a list, and must print out the call to the functions mean, median, mode 
        and with the paramater passed in. 


for example: when i call `value([1,2,2,3,3,3])` it should give me "The mean is 2.3, median is 2.5, and mode is 3"
