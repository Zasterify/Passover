Merge the third practice branch back into master. 

Then create a fourth branch called temperatureConversion (From now on we will call the branches something meaningful/relating to the problema
at hand.)

This time, i will not tell you what to do step by step. I will give you the problem, and you can and should use
everything you know or find out to implement the solution. 

The problem is as follows: 

I want a file with two functions in it. Once of them is called c2f and the other is f2c
    - c2f should take in one parameter which is a number and return a float representation of the number.
    - c2f should convert the number given from celsius to farenheit. (assume the number will always be given in celsius)
    - Similarly f2c should work in exactly the same way, but it should convert from farenheit to celsius.

sample test that you can run to make sure it works:
print(c2f(31)) --> 87.800000001
print(c2f(100)) --> 212.0
print(f2c(-40)) --> -40.0
print(f2c(72)) --> 22.2222222222
