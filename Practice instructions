BEFORE YOU BEGIN. MAKE SURE YOU READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS FIRST. I MEAN EVERYTHING TO THE LAST DETAIL!!

Good! you've made it to a level where you can use IDEs (Look up the definition of this so you understand). 

Below this line, give me at least five other examples of IDEs that are used by people, the IDE does not need
to be specific to python. Can be for any other languages. 

Your first assignment is as follows:

 Delete "hello.py".
 Create a new branch. Call it "firstPractice" (The casing i use is called Camel Case [Look this up too)
 In this new branch, I want you to create a file and call name it "repeat.py".
 Inside "repeat.py" do the follow:
    a. Define a function called `repeat`
    b. The function should ask the user for a word that they would like. (This will be aby word)
    c. The function should then repeat that same word back to the user. 


Example:
    - When I hit run on the computer, it should ask me "Enter a word you would like to repeat". 
    - Once I enter a word, it should say "The word you entered is: `the word goes here`


Two things:
- Your file must contain comments. You need to learn to add comments to things that you write so people who have 
never seen your code can understand without having to decipher the code. 
- For every step that I listed above. I want you to commit and push the changes you made. 


For now you can still come to me in person to ask questions (AFTER you have done some research on google and still cannot 
figure it out. But later on, we will practice conversing over distance that way you get experience with working with 
people who are not physically there with you.
