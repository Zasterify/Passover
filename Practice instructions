Ok. For this next part We are going to do a big review. 

- Again, your message commits do not tell me anything about what you saved. 
Saying "Length of the list one" is useless when someone else is looking at it when you
could have said "listLength function definition" If you come back 5 years later, 
i can bet you will have no idea what those one, two, theee mean. 

So, from here on, your commit meassage must have something to do with what you did in the code.
If you defined a function, say something like "Defined so and so function"
If you added a loop say something like "Added iterative process"
something that if you come back you will understand. I want to be able to look at your commit 
message and understand what you did before you saved without having to open it up

Make sure you follow this. 

For this next part you will have to do this:
- Inside "stats.py", define a function called "verifySum"
- verifySum should have two parameters one a list, and the other a number. Call them givenList, guessedSum respectively
- verifySum should first find the sum of all the numbers in the list and compare that number to guessedSum
- If the numbers are equal to one another, return the boolean "true", else return the boolean "false"


Example of what i can do:

exampleList = [5, 9, 2, 5]
trueExampleSum = 4
falseExampleSum = 2

print(verifySum(exampleList, trueExampleSum)) = Will give me true
print(verifySum(exampleList, falseExampleSum)) = Will give me false
